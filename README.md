A Godot project that implements save and load, contains enemies, movement, and a user- controlled player. In this mini-game, the brain located in the game triggers the next level. 

UGH!
Being a girl zombie is so hard! Boy zombies are ALWAYS trying to hoard all the good human brains, it's SO annoying!

Directions: By using the arrow keys to move forward and jump, avoid making contact with the boy zombies while you take back the human brains that are rightfully yours!
